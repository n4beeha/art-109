		In all honesty, I don't know why they’re making me go through this process time and time again. 
		Sandra, my last doctor, had her credentials revoked for asking inappropriate questions to her patients. 
		I would be perfectly happy with being randomly assigned a new one, but instead, here I am scrolling through options that, to be honest, all seem the same to me.
<br><br>
<i><b>Natasha</b></i> - kind, succinct, American accent, young woman<br>
<i><b>Eddie</b></i> - kind, good with explanations, American accent, middle-aged man<br>
<i><b>Amanda</b></i> - succinct, good at delivering bad news, English accent, middle-aged woman<br>
<i><b>Rishi</b></i> - funny, sharp, Indian accent, young man<br><br>

I click on Natasha’s profile without bothering to read the other descriptions. 
Seems fine. <br><br>
“Hi Nabeeha!” the voice chimed in an excited tone. 
“It seems like you had a pretty rough night last night. 
Would you like to purchase the new <i>17 For a While</i> eye cream by L'Oreal to help get rid of your under-eye circles? 
It is now on sale for only $49.99 and can be delivered to you within the next 15 minutes!”<br><br>
I furrow my eyebrows, quickly grabbing the mirror on my nightstand as I tug at the skin around my eyes. 
“I…will pass,” I reply, but take a mental note of the name for later.<br><br>
“Okay. If you change your mind, just ask!” The cheerful voice exclaims. 
“How else can I help you today?”<br><br>
“Summarize and analyze my dream from last night,” I rub my forehead, struggling to recall it myself, “Use language that’s easy to understand for those outside academia.”<br><br>
“Got it…accessing your dream files now.” A moment later, Natasha continues. 
“Here’s the summary: in your dream, you were on a large white platform with no end in sight from any direction.”<br><br>
On my tablet, a rough rendering of the white platform from my dream appears. <br><br>
“But in front of you, there was a doorway into an elevator in which your friends stood. It was crowded, but—”
“Which friends were in the elevator?”<br><br>
“I am unable to identify these people at this time. They aren't in your doctor profile database.”<br><br>
<i>‘Old friends…college friends.’</i> I think to myself. Friends I haven't seen in so long that they aren’t in the database.
“Please continue,” I prompt, nodding.<br><br>
“Your friend with the long hair and glasses invited you in and claimed there was room for one more person in the elevator.”<br><br>
I let out an amused laugh, watching the crappy animation of the dream’s events, “and I declined.” <i>Of course</i>, this dream is identical to one I had in college. <br><br>
“Mhm!” the tablet replied. “The elevator doors closed, and your friends headed up without you.”<br><br>
“Was there anything else?”<br><br>
“Yes.” Natasha went on, “Subsequent elevators arrived on your floor every 2 minutes, but none of them had space for you. <b>You lost your chance.</b>”<br><br>
I clench my jaw. <br><br>
“This dream is likely a manifestation of your fears regarding the opportunities you've missed during your lifetime.”<br><br>
“No shit,” I whisper under my breath, hopefully quietly enough not to be picked up by the microphone.<br><br>
“The elevator represents the past chances you had, none of which you too—”<br><br>
“End appointment now,” I come off sharper than I intend to as I place the device next to me and climb out of bed, slowly but surely.<br><br>
Everything hurts. My joints, my back — the “doctor” has no solution for it, so I've given up. I trudge along to the next room over. A room full of my physical media. After the internet wipe out 15 years ago, this room is all I have from my past. Years of photos, artwork, effort, memories gone. <br><br>
I reach for the top shelf. I can hear every muscle I'm using complain as I pull down a book that is one wrong move away from falling into pieces — covered in candy wrappers and filled to the brim, it’s a wonder the spine was still able to hold it all together.<br><br>
I feel the familiar front cover with the pads of my fingers, an involuntary smile forming on my lips from the memory of sitting in my family dining room with glue and the wrappers, sticking them just right for their pattern to align on the front. <br><br>
<i>Even its size and weight are familiar to my worn hands</i> — a thought that occurs to me as I flip open the heavy pages. Each page had been embellished with Polaroid pictures, old ticket stubs that have long since worn off, and old notes from friends, none of which are still in circulation.<br><br>
As I gaze into the unfocused and glossy eyes of my old friends, some of the dearest ones I ever made, I have the smartest realization I’ve had since I started that damn study group in college. I pick up the phone and dial a number. I can't remember the last time I did that.<br><br>
