        <h3>Self-Portrait Clock</h3>
        <p>For this work, I chose to focus on my scrapbooking hobby to express a clock as a self-portrait. Since I love
          taking photos, each minute, a new polaroid shows up on the wall. Each millisecond, the camera shutter closes a
          little bit, fully closing each second. Every minute, the camera flashes. At night, each polaroid is attached
          to a small light and the wall turns dark blue. Every hour, a new scrapbook shows up on the shelf. I used
          Procreate to draw each scrapbook's spine to reflect what I typically do or am thinking at the hour. Each
          second, the amount of liquid in the beverage reduces. The beverage changes between water, a smoothie, and milk
          based on the time of day. The lipstick print on the beverage reflects when I am wearing makeup during the day.

        <h3>Digital Scrapbook</h3>
        <p>With this interactive scrapbook page, I strove to replicate the feeling that I get when I look back at old
          scrapbook entries. If I see a picture of a friend and me, I might think about the music that played when we
          took the photo and call them because I thought about them. If I see lyrics to a song that I enjoy, I might
          think about someone I associate with it.</p>
